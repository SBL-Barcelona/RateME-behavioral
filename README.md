# RateME Behavioral

Welcome to the `RateME-behavioral` repository, an innovative project brought to you by the Social Brain Lab Barcelona. This repository is at the forefront of exploring the nuances of social evaluation and decision-making through behavioral experiments.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

"RateME" stands for "Rating and Evaluation in Moral and Ethical contexts," a series of experiments designed to understand how individuals judge actions, intentions, and characters in various scenarios. Our behavioral approach seeks to unravel the complex factors that influence our moral and ethical evaluations.

### ðŸ“Š What's Inside?

- **Experiment Design**: Comprehensive guides and materials for conducting RateME behavioral experiments.
- **Data Collection Tools**: Scripts and templates for gathering and organizing data from participants.
- **Analytical Scripts**: Ready-to-use statistical analysis scripts tailored for evaluating social evaluation experiments.

### ðŸš§ Under Development

As the realms of psychology and ethics continue to expand, so does this repository. We're constantly refining our methods, exploring new questions, and diving deeper into the data.

#### Coming Soon...

- **Interactive Experiments**: Development of web-based platforms for broader participant engagement.
- **Expanded Datasets**: Inclusion of larger, more diverse participant data for comprehensive analysis.
- **Cross-Cultural Studies**: Initiatives to explore how moral and ethical evaluations differ across cultures.

### âœ¨ How to Get Involved

We value the power of collaboration and diverse perspectives in enriching our research. Whether you're a researcher in psychology, a student of ethics, or just someone deeply fascinated by how we make moral decisions, your contributions are welcome.
